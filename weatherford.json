However total well integrity goes far beyond well construction. \r\n\tWeatherford is an oil and gas service company with a presence in every major oil and gas region of the world. Our business is helping our clients to safely and sustainably find, drill, complete, and produce oil and gas fields. \r\n\tWell integrity is a journey. Our workflow, processes, and technologies emphasize a lifetime approach to managing well integrity, from well engineering to final plug and abandonment. \r\n\tWe begin in the design phase with proven well-engineering and project-management expertise through our well-engineering and project-management (WEPM) group. By working with our clients in the early stages, we deliver enhanced well integrity, technological integration, well monitoring, service quality, and process safety that minimize risks for rig workers, the formation, and the environment. \r\n\tNext is drilling. We offer unmatched well-control technologies, including the Microflux\u00ae control system, managed pressure drilling (MPD), and pressurized mud-cap drilling (PMCD). These techniques and technologies not only mitigate drilling hazards in real time, they also provide early-kick detection and ensure well integrity in unstable and challenging formations. \r\n\tIn some wells, our techniques are the only way to safely reach total depth (TD). From fractured wells in south Texas to deepwater pre-salt wells in Brazil, we\u2019ve used underbalanced mud weights to protect the formation and reduce drilling pressure, which helps prevent hole collapses in brittle and weak formations. \r\n\tWell construction executes the engineering plan and sets the groundwork for a lifetime of well integrity. Used in conjunction with our comprehensive completion technologies, our tubular running services create a secure, life-of-well mechanical barrier using technologies such as our JAMPro torque monitoring software. This technology provides real-time configurable data reports, including torque-over turns and speed-over turns, which helps ensure your connections\u2015standard, metal-to-metal seal, and premium\u2015are expertly torqued. \r\n\tWe then produce the well with comprehensive reservoir monitoring and intelligent-alarm capabilities, including i-DO\u00ae and LOWIS\u2122 software and OmniWell\u00ae downhole sensing tools. Our monitoring systems combine with well-integrity evaluation technologies\u2015including the multisensor-caliper (MSC\u2122) tool\u2015to help predict potential loss-of-well integrity. These casing- and cement-integrity evaluation technologies assess potential threats\u2014such as leaks, corrosion, and sand production\u2014that help enable accurate and efficient well-integrity observation. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t  \tCasing and Cement Evaluation\r\n\t\t  \n \r\n\tOnce well integrity issues are defined, we can help you permanently restore a secure wellbore. Using casing-remediation tools, such as our MetalSkin\u00ae solid-expandable liners, along with the MicroSeal\u00ae microannular-sealing system, we help deliver total well integrity throughout the length of the wellbore and annular space. \r\n\tOnce a well has produced beyond its economic lifetime, we can safely and securely plug and abandon the well using innovative tools including our Rig-Free\u00ae pulling-and-jacking units. These innovative units support safe, permanent well abandonment and help you reduce overall project spending by eliminating the use of a rig and the corresponding costs. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t  \tRigless Intervention & Abandonment Technology\r\n\t\t  \n"}, {"name": "Well Abandonment", "description": " \r\n\tWell integrity is a journey.
