{"about": "Cellana, a leading developer of algae-based bioproducts, uses the most productive plants on earth\u2014marine microalgae\u2014to photosynthetically produce its ReNew\u2122 line of Omega-3 EPA and DHA oils, animal feed, and biofuel feedstocks.\n\nCellana\u2019s patented ALDUO\u2122 system, a series of photobioreactors (PBRs)\u00a0coupled with open ponds, enables economic and continuous production of diverse strains of microalgae.\n\nOur ALDUO\u2122 system represents the optimal balance between higher-cost PBRs\u00a0and lower-cost open ponds for consistent production\u00a0without interruption by contamination.\n\nSince 2009, Cellana has operated its Kona Demonstration Facility, a 6-acre, state-of-the-art production and research facility in Hawaii. To date we have generated over 20 tons of algae to become one the most validated and prolific algae production facilities in the world.\n\nVideo:\u00a0Cellana\u2019s Kona Demonstration Facility, a 6-acre, state-of-the-art production and research facility in Hawaii, and the ALDUO\u2122 algae production technology\n\nOver $100 million has been invested in the technologies being developed by Cellana, including through angel investments, government grants and contracts, strategic partner/joint venture funding, and investments made in the technologies in-licensed by Cellana.\n\nCellana intends to construct and operate commercial facilities to produce our ReNew\u2122 product line as integrated algae-based biorefineries.\n\nAt Cellana, it\u2019s a brand ReNew day!
